## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Ascent solves with a four-tier deductive solver

Ascent SHALL provide a solver that finds the unique completion of a graded puzzle,
or reports that it cannot. The solver SHALL be a fixpoint of deduction rules gated
by difficulty — Easy applying only single-position and simple-proximity reasoning,
Normal adding path reasoning, Tricky adding simple single-number reasoning, and
Hard adding full single-number and overlap reasoning. The solver SHALL NOT guess
or backtrack at any difficulty tier.

The generator SHALL use the graded solver to keep every board uniquely soluble at
its target difficulty: it SHALL build a Hamiltonian path by the backbite
algorithm, then either remove clue numbers while the solver still solves
(non-Edges modes, honoring the symmetry and keep-endpoints options) or move
numbers out to arrow clues via a maximal bipartite matching (Edges mode), retrying
until soluble. Generation from a given seed SHALL be reproducible.

#### Scenario: A graded board is solved only at its difficulty

- **WHEN** a board generated at a given difficulty is solved
- **THEN** the graded solver reaches the unique completion at that difficulty, and
  a strictly weaker ruleset does not

#### Scenario: Generation is reproducible from a seed

- **WHEN** the same seed is used twice for the same parameters
- **THEN** both runs produce the identical description

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Ascent grades its difficulty tiers honestly

An Ascent board generated at a difficulty above Easy SHALL NOT be soluble at the
tier below it, in any grid mode.

This diverges from upstream, which has no difficulty gate at all: it blanks clues
(or moves them to edge arrows) while the graded solver still finishes the board and
publishes the result, never asking whether an easier tier would also have done.
Seven of the 22 boards above Easy in this game's own frozen reference fixtures fall
to a lower tier, as did 56 of 180 freshly generated boards.

Because generation is solver-gated at every removal, the correction changes every
description above Easy. Upstream's generation
loop is unbounded, and the gate introduces rejections, so the loop SHALL be bounded.

The gate's probe SHALL run on solver scratch state that carries nothing from any
previous candidate. Ascent's scratch deliberately retains a flag across solves that
permanently weakens the solver once set — an upstream quirk the port reproduces
because it decides which boards exist — so a probe reusing the generator's scratch
would ask a weakened solver whether the easier tier copes, under-reject, and leave
its own state behind to influence the next candidate.

#### Scenario: A board above Easy genuinely needs its own tier

- **WHEN** a board generated above Easy is solved at the tier below it
- **THEN** the solver does not reach a solution
- **AND** solving the same board at its own tier does

#### Scenario: The probe is not weakened by the candidate before it

- **WHEN** the generator tests whether the easier tier solves a candidate
- **THEN** the solver runs from scratch state initialized for that board alone

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Ascent ports the four-tier deductive solver faithfully

**Reason**: Matching upstream's C output was a porting-era aid, retired by the owner on 2026-09-13 as no longer a concern. Its heading promised a faithful port of upstream's solver. The requirement is restated under a name that does not assert fidelity to upstream, which a `MODIFIED` block cannot rename.

**Migration**: Replaced by "Ascent solves with a four-tier deductive solver", whose body is unchanged: the tier ladder, the guess-free rule, the generator and its reproducible seed.
